## How did I use Supabase

- I stored user profile data on supabase as well as user profile pictures. Eventually, I'll store custom workouts as well.
- Supabase auth is used for user account creation and will be used for database access controls.
- User avatar images are stored on Supabase.

## What is this thing?

Since Covid-19 closed my gym, I've been doing my version of Reddit's [r/bodyweightfitness recommended routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine/). I'm ususally listening to a tech podcast while I work out, and I lose my place a lot. I had to start keeping track with a pencil and paper (gasp!), so I wanted to make a simple app to remind me of my place.

At present, you can go to the workout page, add and remove an excercise from the default list, and keep track of your sets. Right now, UI is mobile-first and only.

## To Do

- allow users to CRUD custom workouts
- integrate user info into UI
- polish and design and add media queries
- add TypeScript
