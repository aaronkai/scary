## What is this thing?

Since Covid-19 closed my gym, I've been doing my version of Reddit's [r/bodyweightfitness recommended routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine/). I'm ususally listening to a tech podcast while I work out, and I lose my place a lot. I had to start keeping track with a pencil and paper (gasp!), so I wanted to make a simple app to remind me of my place.

At present, you can go to the workout page, add and remove an excercise from the default list, and keep track of your sets.
